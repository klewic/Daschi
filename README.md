# Daschi

I was inspired by https://data.cityofchicago.org/ while browsing for public datasets that I could use to try out the Shiny framework for R.

You can view the app here https://daschi.shinyapps.io/daschi/.
The version of the app I have hosted online can only pull the last three months of data (loading more
causes timeout errors on the online app, but it can be done if you run the app locally)

Enjoy!
