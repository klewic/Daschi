# Daschi

I wanted to practice building dashboards so I had a go at it using Chicago crime data made publicly available via Socrata.

I was inspired by https://data.cityofchicago.org/ while browsing for public datasets.
Perhaps there's room in the future for more Chicago data based dashboards?

You can play with the app here https://daschi.shinyapps.io/daschi/
though the version of the app posted online can only pull the last three months of data (loading more
causes timeout errors on the online app, but it can be done if you run the app locally!)

Have fun exploring!
